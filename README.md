# Personal Website

This is a simple static HTML website using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. The website serves as a personal portfolio showcasing your work, projects and achievements.

## Setting up the Development Environment

Before you start working on the website, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-website.git
```

2. Change to the project directory.
```bash
cd personal-website
```

3. Install the required npm packages.
```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server.
```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser to access your personal website.

## Building and Deploying the Site

You can build the website for production by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate a `dist` folder containing the production-ready files.

To deploy the website, follow these steps:

1. Choose a hosting provider (e.g., [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), etc.).

2. Follow the hosting provider's instructions to deploy the `dist` folder.

3. Update your domain's DNS settings to point to the hosting provider.

Your personal website should now be live on the internet.
